Failed to get video info: ERROR: [youtube] lSP73qbIynY: Sign in to confirm you’re not a bot. Use --cookies-from-browser or --cookies for the authentication. See https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-yt-dlp for how to manually pass cookies. Also see https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#exporting-youtube-cookies for tips on effectively exporting YouTube cookies

Is this way related to the fix ?

certain videos, particularly those with age restrictions or privacy settings, yt-dlp outputs errors like 'Sign in to confirm you’re not a bot' or mentions age restrictions or private video status.
> Given that this is a public tool, I cannot implement cookie-based authentication. My objective is to enhance the user experience by gracefully handling these specific yt-dlp errors.
> Could you assist me in modifying my Python code to:
>  * Capture the standard error output generated by the yt-dlp command.
>  * Analyze this error output for the presence of specific strings such as 'Sign in to confirm', 'age-restricted', or 'private video'.
>  * If any of these error indicators are found, instead of displaying the raw yt-dlp error, print a user-friendly message to the user, for example: 'Download failed: This video has restrictions (age, privacy, or requires login) and cannot be downloaded publicly.'
>  * If none of these specific error strings are detected, allow the script to proceed with the download process or display the regular yt-dlp output.
> Below is the relevant section of my Python code where I execute the yt-dlp command:
> import subprocess
> 
> def download_video(url):
>     command = ['yt-dlp', url]
>     try:
>         result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
>         print(result.stdout)
>         print("Download successful!")
>     except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
>         print(f"Error during download: {e}")
>         print(f"Stderr: {e.stderr}")
> 
> # Example usage
> video_url = 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL_HERE'
> download_video(video_url)
> 
> Could you provide guidance on how to modify this download_video function to implement the error handling described above?"
