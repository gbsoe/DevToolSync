It looks like you're encountering an issue with your Flask application while it is being loaded by Gunicorn. The error traceback indicates that the application is failing to import the app object from app.py.

Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Check app.py: Ensure that your app.py file has a Flask app instance named app. The file should begin with something like:

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
Check the Import Path: Ensure that the path specified in your Gunicorn command in your .replit file is correct. The command should be gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app, where main is the name of the Python file (without the .py extension) that contains the app object.

Verify No Syntax Errors: Make sure there are no syntax errors in your app.py or any of the files it imports that could prevent the application from loading correctly.

Logging Configuration: Make sure that your logging configuration at the top of app.py is set correctly to capture potential error messages:

import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
Run Application Directly: Temporarily run the application directly using Flask to check if it launches without errors:

python3 main.py
If everything seems to be in order and you're still facing issues, please share snippets of your app.py file, especially the sections where you create the Flask app instance and define routes, so I can help you better.
